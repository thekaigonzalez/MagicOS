### Application Manager

There is a builtin application manager for MagicOS. This loads Windows (and soon games.)

### Instruction video

You can watch the instruction video by opening the application. It tells you everything you need to know, and more.

### External Applications

You can use apps from files since MagicOS Black Release 2, which implements home apps by using the local filesystem.

### Window Titles

If you don't supply a window name, then the application will try to guess it, by using the Application's code-name (Button name)
